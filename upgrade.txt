potential cheeters..."

11/24/19 Fixed PostrgreSQL compatibility error in locallib.php function get_mootyperlessons.
11/24/19 Fixed bug when going to eins.php. Undefined variable $lsnnamepo. When incoming
optional parameter 'lesson' is blank due to starting a new lesson/category name,
$lsnnamepo has to be set to -1, otherwise when starting a new exercise for the current
lesson/category, the optional parameter 'lesson' goes to the $lessonpo. The first part

03/02/19 Did lots more code cleanup based on changes to Roshine. Also worked
on changing the look of the grades table generated by owngrades.php. Big change
is adding a background that matches/uses keybdbgc (keyboard background color)

and Clean. Finally got it today by cutting the padding back to 1px along with width of 39px and height of 30px.
8/12/17 Fine tuning the V2 keyboard files. Added missing background to Japanese (V2) keyboard. Lost some of my work.
NOT sure what happened. I think I did not have template.css and styles.css set the same so that when I made a
a settings change it wiped out my work in styles.css.

box-sizing: border-box; to each one of my classes in styles.css and template.css.

10/11/16 Changed availability check code in view.php so that admin and teachers can always access a MooTyper activity to check grades. Only students are prevented if availability is closed.

=== 3.1.2 ===
07/18/2016 Implemented code to show entries in the Recent Activity Block.
07/30/2016 Implemented code to use open and close dates for MooTyper activities.
07/30/2016 Implemented renderer.php file and started creating functions in it.

to mdl_mootyper table.
08/06/2016 Changed Exercise filename to show "Exercise x of y' instead of a
single meaningless digit.
08/07/2016 Modified config name for recent activity to match other config names.
08/07/2016 Added setting to allow for automatic addition of GMT to export lesson
filenames.

=== 3.1.1 ===
07/01/2016 Previously, I attempted to add a setting for the date and time format
but gave it up to work on other new capabilities and enhancements. Today, I tried
again based on a clue regarding get_config. Took only a few minutes and I now have
it working. Need to finalize the directions and see what codes can be used. Right 
now I know about d, M, Y, G and i as well as comma and colon.
07/02/2016 Added color picker setting for passing grades. Not used for exam as no
pass/fail is implemented for exam.
07/02/2016 Added color picker setting for failing grades. Not used for exam as no

Does not affect old keyboard layout versions.

=== 3.1.0 ===
Working on multiple new capabilities.
05/03/2016 Over the past few days I've added V2 versions of other keyboard layouts.
06/14/2016 Added an Export / edit exercises link in the Administration
block that's visible when looking at the view.php page. It takes you to the
normal exercises.php page and now has links that will let you export lessons
as a .txt file so you can save and or swap lessons that you create.
06/14/2016 Added an Import exercise / category link in the Administration
block that's visible when looking at the view.php page. When clicked it will
check all the files in the MooTyper lesson folder. Filenames that match lessons
already in the database are skipped. Filenames that do not match lessons already
in the database will get added. Once complete you will see a report of what was
done with a contiue link that takes you to the exercises.php page so you can
check the contents of the new lessons.
06/25/2016 Yesterday I updated github with a 3.1.0 Beta version and made a post about
it in the discussion group.
06/26/2016 Last night when doing some testing, I discovered the lesson export
format was not correct. Updated the code in lsnexport.php and pushed to github.
06/30/2016 Modified lesson export format again. Each exported line of text need
both CR adn LF, not just the CR I had been using. With just a CR, the text of the 
first exercise of a lesson would would not show up until it was opend for editing
and then saved. New format works out of the box.
07/01/2016 Released this version on Moodle.

=== 3.0.1 ===
04/01/16 Added English(US) keyboard layout by copying English one.
Redid all number and symbol keys to show shifted and unshifted characters
on one key, by using supscript and subscript tags.
Got rid of the <> key that was by the z key and put them where they belong.
Added the missing backslash plus vertical bar key that was supposed
to be next to the right bracket key.
Changed the Alt gr key to Alt.
Resized some keys to enhance the layout.
Some characters were not being recognized as valid characters for a lesson,
so I added them in the eins.php file. I also added them to the eedit.php file.
04/04/16 Added some CSS changes to make the English(US) keyboard layout look better
especially keys with two symbols on them.
04/04/16 Redid the icon as an SVG file.
04/06/16 Change suspicion indication from red to yellow to make it stand out more.
I also added more characters to the lesson install.php. Made copy of the original
version so I can experiment. 
04/07/16 Added links under the Administration block to go
directly to MooTyper Administration and Add new exercise/category pages. The two
links also use the new icon file.
04/08/16 Changed variable name in install.php from $pikapos to $periodpos.
04/08/16 Added keyboard background color setting for the new keyboard layout.
Have NOT yet figured out the correct "selector" for it in settings.php.
