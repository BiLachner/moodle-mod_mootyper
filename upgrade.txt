the person typed more than 60 chars in 5 seconds (which is
kind of imposible)...or if the exercise took more than 10

potential cheeters..."

=== 3.8.4 ===
01/10/2020 Started dev work to add dictation mode.
01/22/2020 Got all the bits working except being able to play a video in
exercises.php or view.php after I have recorded it in edit.php. Posted help
request in General developer forum.
02/06/2020 Posted to forum again. Still stuck at the same point.
02/10/2020 Posted to forum again. Still stuck at the same point.
02/12/2020 Posted to forum again. Still stuck at the same point.
03/24/2020 Posted progress report to form. Still stuck. Can add, listen to,
and edit in edit.php entry editor. As soon as I save, I cannot get the
file to play.
04/28/2020 Over the past four months, I have made a "boat-load" of changes to
nearly every file in MooTyper. One major one is to start eliminating the
functions in locallib.php and give their own class file in ../classes/local/.
Right now I have most functions in keyboards.php, lessons.php, and results.php.
04/28/2020 Finally figured out how to set round corners to all the buttons.
04/29/2020 Finished rounding buttons.
04/29/2020 Finished moving functions from locallib.php to classes. Had to move
mootyper_update_calendar(stdClass $mootyper, $cmid) into lib.php. Think it
would not work in results.php due to having stdClass in it.

=== 3.8.3 ===
12/27/19 Issue #81 at github - Missing space between user name and exercise name in
the graph when viewing all grades. Fixed and pushed to github master branch.
12/28/19 TRK1_319 Mistake details error reporting added just below the status bar.
12/29/19 Bumped version to 3.8.3 and pushed to github.
12/29/19 TRK1_332 Added new field, mistakedetails to table mdl_mootyper_grades.
12/29/19 TRK1_319 Added code to place countChars(mistakestring) into new field.
12/30/19 TRK1_319 Added code in gview.php and owngrades.php, to place data from
the, mdl_mootyper_grades->mistakedetails, field, into the grades table in the,
Mistakes, column for, View all grades, and, View my grades.
12/31/19 TRK1_333 Converted hard coded, Mistake details, to a language string,
and wrapped it in a div so I can make it align to the left.
12/31/19 Experimenting with .tb1 settings in styles.css to try and keep the hidden
textarea from creating a blank line below the, Mistake details. Might need to make
a single row, two column table, for them.
01/02/20 TRK1_320 layout_imported, line 222 in lsnimport.php fixed.
01/03/20 Minor fix and publish, Armenian(V5) layout.

01/04/20 Some code cleanup based on last version check on Moodle.
01/11/20 TRK1_334 Made code change in gcnext.php that changes undefined to
the definition of the nomistakes string, that I also added. Published to
master branch for next release.
01/11/20 TRK1_338 Got audiodata code working for eedit.php but still needs
work as editor is full width and not showing recordrtc toolbutton.
01/17/20 TRK1_343 & TRK1_303 Added Return button to bottom of exercises.php
that returns you to the MooTyper you started editing from.
01/17/20 TRK1_344 Changed label info, audio player, and buttons, View all
grades, Settings, View my grades, and Continue, to align=left. The reason
was the layout looked odd 99% of the time due to the Continue button
being hidden, except when an exercise was completed.
01/18/20 TRK1_345 Changed hard coded error in eedit.php at line 44 to use
new, $string['mootypexerciseererror'] = 'You must specify an exercise ID';.


=== 3.8.2 ===
12/10/19 TRK1_314 Added lesson ID to the link, Add new exercise to this lesson, ID: XX.
Also moved the link code so now inside the 'if' that checks and hides the link if the
lesson and exercises are not editable by the person viewing the page. This move also
fixed the download link in the table, and shows, 'Not editable by me." message.
12/11/19 TRK1_315 Fixed bug when checking iseditable by me. If mdl_mootyper_lessons->editable
was set to a 1, teachers in course, current course was NOT being compared to the
lesson->courseid, like it should.

12/14/19 TRK1_181 Added settings for keytoptextc but not the code to implement it, yet.
12/14/19 TRK1_311 Added settings for timelimit, but not the code to implement it, yet.
12/15/19 TRK1_181 Added code for keytoptextc and it appears to be working correctly.
12/22/19 TRK1_325, TRK1_322, and TRK1_324 Fixed multiple bugs with mode setting. Mainly
fixed bug where exam mode would only show exercise 1, when others were selected.
12/23/19 TRK1_323 Finally realized the mistake I was making and now have this working
so that during the initial activity setup, get the site default mode. Then check to
see if the activity has something in isexam. First time there will not be. Any time
someone later clicks on Settings, there will be something in isexam, and use it.
12/24/19 TRK1_311 Exercise timelimit coded and appears to be working correctly.
12/24/19 TRK1-326 and TRK1_327 Added timelimit setting to the labels above the
grade tables in gview.php and owngrades.php
12/24/19 TRK1_168 TRK1_311 Reopened as I discovered I could not change from a site default
of any positive number down to a zero. Discovered that I could not do the same for
timelimit and for %. Fixed and testing. Added TRK1_328.
12/25/19 TRK1_329 Added timelimit to the first line of output in the csvexport file.
12/26/19 TRK1_168 Required WPM code needed to be changed as in older Moodles it
was resetting to site defaultwpm each time you went to Settings page.
12/26/19 TRK1_330 For convenience, I added a Cancel button to the settings page.

=== 3.8.1 ===
11/24/19 Fixed PostrgreSQL compatibility error in locallib.php function get_mootyperlessons.
11/24/19 Fixed bug when going to eins.php. Undefined variable $lsnnamepo. When incoming
optional parameter 'lesson' is blank due to starting a new lesson/category name,
$lsnnamepo has to be set to -1, otherwise when starting a new exercise for the current
lesson/category, the optional parameter 'lesson' goes to the $lessonpo. The first part
was missing.
11/30/19 TRK1_284 Created exercise_completed event and pushed to github.
12/01/19 TRK1_304 Created exam_completed event and modified examdone string
then pushed to github.

have been converted to small primary buttons, with the vertical bar replaced

12/03/19 Temporarily added suggested new permissions for mod/mootyper:viewcategory
and mod/mootyper:editcategory. Discussing what is needed with pmaneggia. I think
just checking for site admin is the best way to go.
12/03/19 TRK1_307 Created new German(V5)-icons keyboard layout. Still needs some
final checking, but I have published it to github for feedback from pmaneggia.
12/03/19 TRK1_190 Now have lesson_completed event working.

more to include whose grade and for which exercise it was that was being deleted.

=== 3.6.1 ===
04/12/19 As of 11:30 AM, I have finally gotten my Korean(V5) keyboard to start
recognizing Korean characters, without breaking other layouts.
04/13/19 TRK1_200 When looking at the Lessons page generated by exercises.ph, I have
added a link above the exercises table that will take you to the eins.php page
with the lesson name already selected so you can add a new exercise to the lesson.

breaking the scroll function.

=== 3.6.0 === Working on BETA
03/01/19 Doing lots of code cleanup based on working on Roshine.
03/02/19 Did lots more code cleanup based on changes to Roshine. Also worked
on changing the look of the grades table generated by owngrades.php. Big change
is adding a background that matches/uses keybdbgc (keyboard background color)
so the table can match the view.php page and color coordinate with a course
or site theme color scheme.
03/03/19 Made the same background changes to the page generated by gview.php.
Both grade viewing page tables now also include a heading the lists the mode
and the name of the Lesson/Category.
03/03/19 HUGE code change. I eliminated the section of code that generated
the grade view for an exam, in gview.php. I now use the Lesson and Practice
part of the code to also generate results when generating a grade report
for an exam. As part of the change, I was also able to eliminate the function
used by exam mode to retrieve exam results data from the database.
03/03/19 In almost every php file, I changed to a new require format as seen
in the Moodle documentation for code style.
03/04/19 Worked on adding background frames and color to all the pages using
setting for the keyboard background.
03/08/19 Created new English(USV5) keyboard layout that only highlights one
of the shift keys for uppercase letters and symbols. Highlight the shiftkey
opposite to the side of the keyboard where the key is. e.g. A uses shiftright.
03/09/19 Created new V5 layouts for Dvorak and Spanish layouts.
03/10/19 Changed code to csvexport so the filename is now the lesson name
with all whitespace removed. First row of the file now shows the mode,
the lesson name, and the required goal.
03/10/19 Ran codechecker on everything and pushed changes to master branch
at git hub as a MATURITY_BETA version.
03/11/19 Fixed an error in the classes/event/course_module_view.php file
that was causing an error when clicking a log link that should take you
to the MooTyper that was listed in the log as being viewed.
03/12/19 Renamed event grade_removed to grade_deleted to comply with verb list.

=== 3.1.1 ===
07/01/2016 Previously, I attempted to add a setting for the date and time format
but gave it up to work on other new capabilities and enhancements. Today, I tried
again based on a clue regarding get_config. Took only a few minutes and I now have
it working. Need to finalize the directions and see what codes can be used. Right 
now I know about d, M, Y, G and i as well as comma and colon.

=== 3.1.0 ===
Working on multiple new capabilities.
05/03/2016 Over the past few days I've added V2 versions of other keyboard layouts.
06/14/2016 Added an Export / edit exercises link in the Administration
block that's visible when looking at the view.php page. It takes you to the
normal exercises.php page and now has links that will let you export lessons
as a .txt file so you can save and or swap lessons that you create.
06/14/2016 Added an Import exercise / category link in the Administration
block that's visible when looking at the view.php page. When clicked it will
check all the files in the MooTyper lesson folder. Filenames that match lessons
already in the database are skipped. Filenames that do not match lessons already
in the database will get added. Once complete you will see a report of what was
done with a contiue link that takes you to the exercises.php page so you can
check the contents of the new lessons.
06/25/2016 Yesterday I updated github with a 3.1.0 Beta version and made a post about
it in the discussion group.
06/26/2016 Last night when doing some testing, I discovered the lesson export
format was not correct. Updated the code in lsnexport.php and pushed to github.
06/30/2016 Modified lesson export format again. Each exported line of text need
both CR adn LF, not just the CR I had been using. With just a CR, the text of the 
first exercise of a lesson would would not show up until it was opend for editing
and then saved. New format works out of the box.
07/01/2016 Released this version on Moodle.

=== 3.0.1 ===
04/01/16 Added English(US) keyboard layout by copying English one.
Redid all number and symbol keys to show shifted and unshifted characters
on one key, by using supscript and subscript tags.
Got rid of the <> key that was by the z key and put them where they belong.
Added the missing backslash plus vertical bar key that was supposed
to be next to the right bracket key.
Changed the Alt gr key to Alt.
Resized some keys to enhance the layout.
Some characters were not being recognized as valid characters for a lesson,
so I added them in the eins.php file. I also added them to the eedit.php file.
04/04/16 Added some CSS changes to make the English(US) keyboard layout look better
especially keys with two symbols on them.
04/04/16 Redid the icon as an SVG file.
04/06/16 Change suspicion indication from red to yellow to make it stand out more.
I also added more characters to the lesson install.php. Made copy of the original
version so I can experiment. 
04/07/16 Added links under the Administration block to go
directly to MooTyper Administration and Add new exercise/category pages. The two
links also use the new icon file.
04/08/16 Changed variable name in install.php from $pikapos to $periodpos.
04/08/16 Added keyboard background color setting for the new keyboard layout.
Have NOT yet figured out the correct "selector" for it in settings.php.
